# Changelog

## Next

### Added

- Add configurable `SubscriptionPublishingInterval` properties to OPC UA Client
- Add configurable `MinPublishingInterval` and `MaxPublishingInterval` properties to OPC UA Server
- Support envelope children on OPC UA data points: a `Status code`, a `Source timestamp` and, on the client, a `Server timestamp` child, each addressing one field of the OPC UA value of their parent instead of a node of their own

### Changed

- Add new icons to DataPorts
- Update `.yaml` files format to `2.0.0` (`ViciOne.Tree.Builder`)
- Unify namespaces in DataPort yamls
- Limit the OPC UA client browse to the `MaxDepth` of `64` levels declared for the DataPort node tree; a server nesting deeper now fails the data port connect with an error naming the node and the path down to it
- Rename the company to `ViciOne open automation gmbh` in the package metadata, the license and the `Author` of the `.yaml` files
- Require `ViciOne.Tree.Builder` `3.0.0` and cluster management `3.0.0`
- **Breaking:** Rename the connection node Id `OPCUA-Client` to `OpcUaClientInstance` and `OPCUA-Server` to `OpcUaServerInstance`; existing configurations that use the old Id are not migrated
- Write the property display names of both `.yaml` files in sentence case, name the unit of the publishing intervals, and replace the MQTT-derived folder description and the descriptions that only repeated a property name with real help texts
- **Breaking:** Replace the `Status` node property of the OPC UA server with the `Status code` envelope child of a data point; a configuration that linked the property has to link the child instead
- **Breaking:** Serve an OPC UA server data point read-only unless its configuration clears `Read only`, which now defaults to set; a data point that is meant to take client writes has to clear it
- **Breaking:** Implement `IExternalOutgoingCommunication` directly in `OpcUaServerDataPortOutgoing` instead of deriving from `DataPortOutgoingCommunicationWithPropertyHandling`; `SendAsync` takes the values of a cycle in one collection, and the overload with separate process and property values is gone
- Serve an OPC UA variable with the status code and the source timestamp linked to the envelope children of its data point, a linked status code as it is even for a value that is not a number, and forward the ones a client writes on the same channels; writable data points now advertise `StatusWrite` and `TimestampWrite`
- Forward the status code, the source timestamp and the server timestamp an OPC UA server sends with a subscribed value on the channels of the envelope children of its data point instead of dropping them, and write a value with the status code and the source timestamp linked to those children instead of the `Good` and the unset timestamp every written value defaulted to
- **Breaking:** Refuse an anonymous OPC UA client session on a server that is not configured for anonymous authentication, instead of granting it whatever the server advertises; `User Authentication Type` now defaults to `Basic`, and a server set to `Basic` without a user and a password refuses to start rather than accepting every client unchecked
- Name the server in the error an OPC UA server data port fails with when it is created for an already started server, and state that every data port using that server has to be disposed first; it used to read `Node manager is already initialized`

### Fixed

- Fix OPC UA client `TrustedPeerCertificates` not being configured (was incorrectly assigned to `TrustedIssuerCertificates`)
- Fix OPC UA client outgoing data port failing to connect a second time, which made every engine stop and start cycle after the first one fail
- Fix OPC UA client data ports staying half-connected when a connect fails part way, which made every later connect report success without subscribing to or writing any node
- Fix OPC UA client sessions not being closed when the shared client is disposed, which left them open on the server until they timed out
- Fix OPC UA client logging keep-alive failures for a data port that was disconnected on purpose, which pointed at a network fault that was not there
- Fix OPC UA client data ports not connecting to a server that federates another server's address space
- Fix OPC UA client reading only the first page of a folder's references while browsing, which made every node configured below a large folder fail to connect as if the server did not have it
- Fix OPC UA client browsing an address space whose hierarchy contains a cycle until the recursion overflowed the stack, which killed the process and every other data port running in it
- Fix OPC UA client outgoing data port reporting an unmapped channel as a `KeyNotFoundException` thrown inside the write, once part of the batch had already been submitted; the channel is now named and nothing is written
- Fix OPC UA client data ports reporting a node that affects no channel as affecting more than one, and a node that affects several as `Sequence contains more than one element`; both errors now name the node and the channels it affects
- Fix OPC UA client outgoing data port reporting two nodes that affect the same channel with a bare `ArgumentException`; the error now names the channel and both nodes
- Fix OPC UA server turning every client write into an internal error when a data point's configured minimum or maximum was a different number type than the written value, such as a whole number limit on a float data point; the two are now compared as numbers
- Fix OPC UA server letting an exception escape into the OPC UA stack when a client writes to a data point it holds no configuration for; the write is now refused with `BadInternalError`
- Fix OPC UA server logging an account lockout on every failed login, which filled the security audit trail with lockouts that never happened
- **Breaking:** Fix OPC UA client reporting the time a notification was published as the timestamp of the value it carried, which moved every value to the moment the server batched it rather than the moment it was produced; the source timestamp is now used, falling back to the server timestamp and then to the publish time when a server sends neither, so the values of a device whose clock is off now move with that clock
- Fix OPC UA server data ports reporting a successful connect while the server was not listening, which happened once an engine teardown had stopped more data ports than it had started; a stop now only counts for a data port that started the server, and any other stop is ignored and logged
- Fix OPC UA server data ports reporting a successful connect after their server was already released; the connect now fails
- Fix OPC UA server incoming data ports failing their disconnect with `Node manager is not initialized` when the connect before it never succeeded, which made the engine teardown fail instead of releasing the port
- Fix OPC UA server incoming data ports subscribing to the shared server once per connect, so a port the engine connected twice reported every value twice and went on reporting values after it was disconnected
- Fix OPC UA server being disposed without being stopped, which dropped the sessions of connected clients instead of shutting them down in order; a server that refuses to stop or dispose is now reported and no longer keeps the remaining servers from being shut down
- Fix OPC UA server staying started after the data port that started it was removed, which kept it listening until the whole engine shut down; it is now stopped as soon as the last data port that started it is released
- Fix OPC UA server data ports failing to shut down when the shared server refused to stop, which broke the engine teardown and left no way to create a data port for that server again; the failure is now reported and the data port shuts down
- Fix OPC UA client and server shutting down with `Cannot access a disposed object` when their shared client or server was already shut down; shutting down twice, and releasing a data port afterwards, are now both accepted

- Configure explicit `TransportQuotas` and `ServerConfiguration` session limits for OPC UA server (max message size, max session count, operation timeout, request throttling) to harden against denial-of-service attacks
- Enable OPC UA stack tracing for security and error events
- Add configurable `SecurityPolicy` to OPC UA server (`None`, `Basic256Sha256_Sign`, `Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt`, `Aes256_Sha256_RsaPss_SignAndEncrypt`); default is `Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt` — `MessageSecurityMode.None` is no longer offered unless explicitly selected
